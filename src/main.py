        Based on the following information about '{company_name}', an HVAC company, draft a personalized outreach email.
        The goal is to propose our AI consulting services to help them automate tasks and improve response times.

        Company Name: {company_name}
        Customer Reviews: "{reviews}"

        Generate ONLY the body for a personalized outreach email. Do NOT include a subject line.
        The email should be professional, concise, and friendly. It should reference the company's reputation based on the reviews, and offer a free audit.
        Here is a template to follow, but adapt it based on the reviews:

        Hi [Contact Name],

        Hope you're doing well. I came across {company_name} and was really impressed by [mention something positive from the reviews or their general reputation].

        I run a small AI automation consultancy focused specifically on HVAC businesses. Right now, we're offering a free audit to help companies like yours identify ways to:

        - Recover missed leads with 24/7 chatbots and voice agents
        - Automate repetitive tasks like scheduling, follow-ups, and CRM updates
        - Improve response times without adding headcount

        We're looking to partner with just one or two companies in your area this month to custom-build solutions around real bottlenecks. No pressure or pitch â€” just a free audit to show what's possible.

        Would you be open to a quick call next week to see if it's worth exploring?

        Best,
